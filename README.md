# skfmath
A math library, in C.

## POSSIBLE QUESTIONS
### Why should I use this over other math libraries?
You probably shouldn't.

### Why does this exist then?
Primarily as a way for me to learn linear algebra.
I am sharing this in the hopes that maybe it can help some other people learn as well.

## DESIGN GOALS
* Fast *enough* to use for most applications.
* Provide *enough* functionality to be comfortable to use in most applications.
* All code *must* be written in C.

## NON-GOALS
* I don't plan on accelerating this library with SSE optimizations... At least not currently.
* No matrix types beyond mat4 are planned to be supported. If you need a matrix, a mat4 will probably work fairly well.

## SUPPORTING
I don't currently have any sort of way to accept donations and I don't plan on it.
The best way to support this project is by either using it or contributing to it.
Contributions don't just mean code contributions either, you can contribute just by reporting issues or suggesting enhancements.
